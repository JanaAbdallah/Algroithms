# Algorithms in C

This repository contains a collection of algorithms implemented in C. These programs cover various fundamental and advanced concepts, serving as examples for understanding and applying algorithmic techniques.

## Folder Structure

The repository includes the following algorithms:

1. **Closest Pair**
   - Implementation of the Closest Pair algorithm to find the two points that are closest to each other in a given set.

2. **Counting Inversion**
   - Calculates the number of inversions in an array, which measures how far the array is from being sorted.

3. **Disjoint Set**
   - Implementation of the Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure for efficient union and find operations.

4. **Graph**
   - Basic graph operations and representations.

5. **Kruskal's Algorithm**
   - Implementation of Kruskal's algorithm for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a weighted graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/JanaAbdallah/Algorithms-in-C.git
   
   cd Algorithms-in-C

3. Compile any of the C files using a compiler:
   
   gcc -o output Closest_pair.c
   
   ./output


5. Repeat the above steps for the desired algorithm files.
